        info: "From his earliest public appearances as a mischievous redheaded toddler, Prince Harry has captured the hearts of royal enthusiasts around the world, while his marriage to Meghan Markle has only endeared him further. In Harry and Meghan, Britain's leading expert on the young royals offers an in-depth look at the wayward prince turned national treasure. Nicholl sheds new light on growing up royal, Harry's relationship with his mother, his troubled youth and early adulthood, and how his military service in Afghanistan inspired him to create his legacy, the Invictus Games. She uncovers new information about Harry's past relationships and reveals the true story of his romance with Meghan Markle, the smart and spirited American who captured his heart. Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love features interviews with friends, those who have worked with the prince, and former Palace aides. Nicholl reveals behind-the-scenes details about the run up to the couple's spectacular wedding day, their first tours as a married couple, and their preparations for the arrival of the youngest new royal. Harry and Meghan is a compelling portrait of the Royal Family's most popular royal couple and the story of the most gripping royal romance in a decade.",

        info: "Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of NIKE | In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of his Plymouth, Knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of start-ups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all start-ups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognisable symbols in the world today.\n" +
            "But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, he tells his story. Candid, humble, wry and gutsy, he begins with his crossroads moment when at 24 he decided to start his own business. He details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream - along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls how his first band of partners and employees soon became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.",
